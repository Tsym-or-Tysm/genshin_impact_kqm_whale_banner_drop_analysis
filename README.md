# Introduction
Small repository that cleans/stacks wish data from KQM discord whales into a usable dataset for general analysis, along with some basic analyses.

To use the final data, you can use the stacked file in "Output/genshin_whale_wish_data_stacked_anonymized.csv". Current dataset contains upwards of 125k wish observations across 39 accounts. Current banner distributions are roughly:
- 50% character event wishes
- Less than 1% novice wishes
- 20% permanent wishes
- 30% weapon event wishes

All actual identifying information has been hashed to avoid having their info out in the open.

# Planned Updates
- [ ] Add data on banner duration and rate up characters to the repository for banner specific analyses
- [ ] Add some of the code that runs basic statistics to the repo
- [ ] Run some of the additional planned analyses including pity mechanics and confirming analytical/simulated solutions to wish rates

# Credits
- Sase from KQM for taking the initial initiative to get people to submit their data
- Everyone who has been generous enough to take the time to submit their data.
